# Custom Pages

Create and manage pages and snippets with the Custom Pages module, an intuitive and powerful page building system. From simple Markdown pages and embedded external tools to fully templated layouts with dynamic content, you have full control over your content. Choose from multiple content types such as Markdown, Iframe, Link, HTML, and Templates, allowing you to create anything from landing pages to interactive dashboards.

## Key Features:

- **Structure View:** Manage your page in a centralized visual overview. Reorder elements, access context actions, or edit layouts.
- **Templates:** Create reusable layout and container templates. Combine containers, elements to build consistent and dynamic pages across your network.
- **Multiple Targets:** Add custom Pages or Snippets, globally or in Spaces; including main navigation, dashboard, Space menu, and stream sidebar.
- **Resources:** Add custom CSS and JS per template to fine-tune the design and behavior of your containers.
- **Integration:** Add data from other HumHub modules directly into your custom pages using dynamic elements.
- **Filters & Modifiers:** Use the built-in Twig filters and custom methods for advanced logic and formatting inside templates.
